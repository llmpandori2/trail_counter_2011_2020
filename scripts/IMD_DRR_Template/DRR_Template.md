# Background & Introduction
The Background & Summary should provide an overview of the study design, the assay(s) performed, and the data generated, including any background information needed to put this study in the context of previous work and the literature, and should reference literature as needed. The section should also briefly outline the broader goals that motivated collection of the data, as well as their potential reuse value. We also encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview of the study and assay(s) design. 

# Methods
The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). See the detailed section in our submission guidelines for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).

Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section.

Authors are encouraged to consider creating a figure that outlines the experimental workflow(s) used to generate and analyse the data output(s) (Figure 1).






## Data Collection and Sample Processing Methods (optional)
Include a description of field methods and sample processing 

## Additional Data Sources (optional)
Provide descriptions (with citations) of other data sources used.

## Data Processing (required if done)
Summarize process and results of any QC processes done that manipulate, change, or qualify data.

## Code Availability (required)
For all studies using custom code in the generation or processing of datasets, a statement must be included in the Methods section, under the subheading "Code availability", indicating whether and how the code can be accessed, including any restrictions to access. This section should also include information on the versions of any software used, if relevant, and any specific variables or parameters used to generate, test, or process the current dataset. Actual analytical code should be provided in Appendices.

# Data Records (required)
The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated
with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and
to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data
record should be cited as described below. A data citation should also be placed
in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical
procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record.

Tables should be used to support the data records, and should clearly indicate
the samples and subjects (study inputs), their provenance, and the experimental
manipulations performed on each (please see example Tables below). They should
also specify the data output resulting from each data-collection or analytical
step, should these form part of the archived record.

## Required Elements for this Section

### Summary of datasets created. Example of stock text to include. ###

Two datasets were generated as a part of this effort (Table 2):

* **Dataset 1 FULL TITLE.** Comma-separated text file enumerating the specific taxa considered to have federal conservation status in NPS park units. These data were compiled by the National Park Service Biological Resources Division and were last updated on XX. Available at https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2272463. 

* **Dataset 2 FULL TITLE.** Comma-seperated text file enumerating the park-specific specific taxa about which data must be protected from release to the public based on federal conservation status. This dataset includes all taxa identified by the USFWS as well as their child taxa and taxonomic synonyms. Available at https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2272464. 


*Also include a table explaining provenance of datasets*

See Appendix for additional notes and examples.

# Data Quality Evaluation (required)
The Data Quality Evaluation section should present any analyses that are needed
to support the technical quality of the dataset. This section may be supported
by figures and tables, as needed. *This is a required section*; authors must
provide information to justify the reliability of their data. Wherever possible
& appropriate, data quality evaluation should be presented in the context of
data standards and quality control procedures as prescribed in the projectâ€™s
quality assurance planning documentation.

**Required elements for this section**

*Stock Text to include:*

The data within the data records listed above have been reviewed by staff in the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency with documented data quality standards, as well as for usability and reproducibility. The *Dataset 2 FULL TITLE* is suitable for its intended use as of the date of processing (2022-04-08).

*Required Table*

Summary of any data qualification codes used, their definitions, and the fields to which they apply.
